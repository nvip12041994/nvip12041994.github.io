### My story

**Meaning of your life**. Your grown up town, your old friends, your old memories. It's about moving on. Even though you don't want to, you have no choice but to take the next step. Moving on to your next life is scary, but that's something you have to overcome your fears because if you think about it, nothing lasts forever.
